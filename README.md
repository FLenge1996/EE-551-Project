## Introduction
Python Project for EE-551

Author: Frank Lenge
## Purposal
Project: Simple Math Game 

Info: The goal of this project is to create a simple math game in Python.

## Completed
### Levels: 
-Each level emphasises a mathmatical operation by asking 10 questions

-Addition: 10 addition problems

-Subtraction: 10 subtraction problems

-Multiplication: 10 multiplication problems

-Division: 10 division problems

-Exit: Player will win once they complete all levels otherwise will tell the player to complete all the levels.

-Quit: Implemented to exit the game if they dont want to complete all the levels 

-Hallway: Used in order to exit a level and return to the level select

-Conditions: Passing a level will update the key and return player to the level select and Failing a level will tell the player that they need to work on the level's math operation and return to the level select

### Player:
-Name: Gets player name to use throughout the game

-Life counter: If 3 or more questions are wrong then player will fail the level

-Status Screen: type 'status' on level select, tells which rooms the player has completed

-Time Trials: in status menu you will see time it took to complete a level

## To Do:
Have a set of levels based on different math concepts
Possible levels being: 

-Dot Product

-Cross Product

-Summations
